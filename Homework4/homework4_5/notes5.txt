This program will create an an array of random numbers and then call heapsort.c . Heapsort first builds a heap by starting at $\frac{N}{2}$ and checking the heap property in this case that element i is larger that the element at either 2i or 2i +1(known as children). By doing this we have the largest element at the top of the heap. We then enter the second phase where we swap the last element with the top element and then check if it larger than the children if not we swap those elements recursively. After the elements are sorted we run a simple bisection algorighm (or binary search) where we start from the end and begining look at the middle and depending if the element we are looking for is less or more than than he middle we recusively search into that section.
