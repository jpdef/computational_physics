This program reads in x,y, and error values from a file. By calculating the values for the matrix U represented by an array. After that we $a_0$ the intercept and $a_1$ the slope and their respective errors are simply computed from this array. Finally the function chi sq() calculates the $\chi^2$ value. Afterwards for part c the program calculate the Quality by computing $1 - \frac{1}{\Gamma(\frac{M}{2})} \int_0^{\frac{\chi^2}{2}} y^{\frac{M}{2}-1}e^{-y} dy$
