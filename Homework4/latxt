For the given anhamornic oscilitor, this program integrates over the ode with both a fourth order sympletic algorighm and fourth order runge-kutta. At each iteration the program outputs the deviation of the energy produce from each algorighm from the orginal energy. At the same time keeps track of  the maximum deviation.


It goes to show that at low periods the runge kutta algorighm maybe more precision since its energy deviates, but at higher time periods RK4 deviation growths while PERFL seems to ocsiliate around the intial energy.
